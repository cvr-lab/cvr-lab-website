      text: |-
        We are part of the [Department of Computer Engineering, Automation and Robotics](https://icar.ugr.es/) at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es). Our focus is active vision: sensors that change their point of view, adapt how they perceive their environment, and select the information the task needs, so that robots can make smart decisions in real time.
